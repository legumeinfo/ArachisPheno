The subjects of the studies may also include in vitro plant structures (PO:0000004). A plant treatment is the most specific, and may be a component of a plant growing condition, and the plant study type. The broadest classes are the plant study types where the terms can be used to identify the growth study facility. Each growth facility (field study, growth chamber, greenhouse, etc) is a environment on its own and may also involve instances of biotic and abiotic treatments and different growing conditions."
